# Star database

The stars plotted in SkyMap all come from the Hipparcos, Tycho and Tycho-2 catalogues published by ESA.

## History

The Hipparcos catalogue (118218 stars) was first published in 1997, together with the larger Tycho catalogue (1058332 stars). 
In 2000, the Tycho-2 catalogue was published, containing even more stars (2539913) at a slightly higher accuracy than Tycho-1.
In 2007, an new reduction of the Hipparcos catalogue was published with more accurate astrometrics.
